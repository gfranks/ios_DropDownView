DropDownView
============

DropDownView from top of device for user input and notifications with lots of goodies. Inspired by UIAlertView, somewhat.
This DropDownView is supported for both the iPhone and iPad (iOS 4+ but iOS 5.x SDK must be used) and also supports ARC. 
The view is positioned centered along the Y-axis.
